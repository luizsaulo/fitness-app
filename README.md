# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Fitness App

In this project I bring a variety of new functionalityes that were unknown to me before this. This was a great jorney that brought me great experience since I had to consume a real external API with some really insteresting subjects that may concern and impact a few people. The application brings am enormous list of exercises and features similar exersises as well as other exercises that can be made using the same machine. It is a dynamic Single Page Application and I hope it brings value to my portfolio.
